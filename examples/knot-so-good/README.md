## Non-comprehensive list of prerequisites

### `trunk`

```
cargo install --locked trunk
```

## Run

From this directory on your machine, run

```
trunk serve --port 3000
```

and then navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Immediate, obvious limitations

Aside from how ugly and snowflakey this example is, it also doesn't list
the possible moves in a useful way. This should be fixed next so that
users don't have stumble at blind guesses of the required syntax.
